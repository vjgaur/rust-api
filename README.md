# rust-api
Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. With Actix, I can build an elegant REST API that is fast and reliable.

The purpose of this sample is to test how performant a Rust API can be. As part of this project, I will create an API for reading and writing data from and to PostgreSQL databases.
